## HoneyEQL Changelog - 2020-05-01

## Documentation Update

HoneyEQL's documentation has been completely revamped and now available in [cljdocs](https://cljdoc.org/d/org.graphqlize/honeyeql).

## Syntax Improvement

While using HoneyEQL in an internal project at work, came across certain pain points with respect to syntax. In response to that, I have added some overrides to the EQL specification in HoneyEQL. 

HoneyEQL supports two modes of using EQL.

* `:eql.mode/strict` - The query should adhere to the specifications of EQL.
* `:eql.mode/lenient` - It supports both EQL specifications and HoneyEQL overrides of EQL specifications for ease of use.

Based on your requirements, you can choose between the two during the initialization of HoneyEQL. By default HoneyEQL supports `:eql.mode/lenient`.

The changes are [documented here](https://cljdoc.org/d/org.graphqlize/honeyeql/0.1.0-alpha29/doc/query-syntax). 

```clojure
; eql.mode/strict syntax
[{[:actor/id 1] 
  [:actor/actor-id
   :actor/first-name
   :actor/last-name
   :actor/last-update]}]

; eql.mode/lenient syntax
{[:actor/id 1] 
 [:actor/*]}
```

```clojure
; eql.mode/strict syntax
(let [actor-id 148]
  (heql/query
    db-adapter
    `{[:actor/actor-id ~actor-id] ; syntax quote + unquote
      [:actor/first-name
      {(:actor/films {:order-by [[:film/title :desc]]}) 
        [:film/title]}]}))

; eql.mode/lenient syntax
(let [actor-id 148]
  (heql/query
    db-adapter
    {[:actor/actor-id actor-id]
      [:actor/first-name
      {[:actor/films {:order-by [[:film/title :desc]]}]
        [:film/title]}]}))

```

## Filter Based On Relationship Attributes Existence

Using HoneyEQL, we can now filter by the existence of relationship attributes.

Let's assume that we have a schema like below

![](https://www.graphqlize.org/img/author_course_er_diagram.png)

if we want to filter the authors who have at-least one course, we can query it as

```clojure
; :eql.mode/lenient syntax
{[[] {:where [:exists :author/courses]}]
 [:author/first-name :author/last-name]}

; :eql.mode/strict syntax
[{([] {:where [:exists :author/courses]}) 
 [:author/first-name :author/last-name]}]
```

The reverse is also possible by using it in conjunction with :not. i.e filtering authors who don't have any courses.

```clojure
; :eql.mode/lenient syntax
{[[] {:where [:not [:exists :author/courses]]}]
 [:author/first-name :author/last-name]}

; :eql.mode/strict syntax
[{([] {:where [:not [:exists :author/courses]]}) 
 [:author/first-name :author/last-name]}]
```

## Bug Fixes

* Support for [Foreign Keys Without the Id Suffix](https://cljdoc.org/d/org.graphqlize/honeyeql/0.1.0-alpha29/doc/attributes#foreign-key-without-the-id-suffix) added.
* Null Check during coercion.
* Many-to-Many join attribute metadata fix.
